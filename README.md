# Sentiment-Analysis-For-Mental-Health-Sites-and-Forums

This Python program uses Natural Language Toolkit's (NLTK) VADER to perform sentiment analysis and help understand the emotional dynamics within mental health platforms. The program analyzes sentiments from texts generated by individuals sharing their thoughts and seeking support on these platforms, saves the data in a csv file and visualises it as a bar graph. The goal is to provide contextual awareness, enable early intervention, and provide customised user experience to foster positive online mental health communities.
